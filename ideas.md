# Mechanics

## Paddle needs to pick up (bonuses)

> multiple balls (2 for pickup, 3 if ball hits)
> multiple paddles (2 for pickup, 3 for if ball hits)
> bigger paddle size (slightly bigger for pickup, a lot biger if ball hits)
> slower balls (ball slower for pickup, ball normal speed if ball hits) 
> ball noclip mode (short duration for pickup, long duration if ball hits)
> extra ball (bottom sealed off for normal pickup, extra ball if ball hits)
> sticky paddle (just sticky for pickup, trajectory if ball hits)
> mortar (throws short term grenade which must be hit with a ball, explodes immediately when mortar lands)
> one shot shotgun (wide spread when picked up, tight spread when ball hits)
> few bullets (few bullets when picked up. More bullets when ball hits)
> weaker gravity (weak gravity for pickup, reverse gravity when ball hits)

## when brick is touched (maluses)

> faster ball
> one bumper appears whch needs to be hit multiple times to be destroyed (gives no points)
> black hole - attracts ball
> white hole - repulses ball
> fills or strengthens entire row or column
> extra gravity
> more convex paddle
> convex paddle
> cancer - slowly infects surrounding bricks
> star - spreads few stars on a level which must be collected by a ball in a given time. Bonus if all stars collected
> invisible paddle
> reversed controls
> everything gives zero points until brick is destroyed. Then points are doubled

## Skill based bonus mechanics

> Shooting ball with bullet makes ball stronger, givng more points
> If ball hits a falling powerup, powerup is stronger
> each nerf adds score multiplier
> something flies back and forth and drops bombs on bricks making bricks worth less or giving them maluses
> Multiple maluses and bonuses are possible at the same time (unless mechanics are completely incompatible)

## Each mechanic is introduced gradually. One per level
After many intro levels and hand-crafted leveles, game goes into infinite mode, where levels are randomly generated, each having slightly greater difficulty.
Greater difficulty, means more maluses and less bonuses.
High-score is saved to a hi-score list.
